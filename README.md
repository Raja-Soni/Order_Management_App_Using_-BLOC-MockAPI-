## ❓ Ques: What is this Project?

**Ans:**

1. **Sales Order Listing Page**  
   - Pulled sales order data from a mock/dummy API.  
   - Displayed key details: Customer Name, Order Date, Total Amount, and Status (Pending/Delivered) ordered as newest to oldest according to date & time.  
   - Added filters such as *All Orders*, *Today’s Orders*, *Pending Orders*, *Delivered Orders*.  

2. **Create New Sales Order Page**  
   - Built a form with fields: Customer Name, Product(Dropdown local List), Quantity, and Rate.  
   - Implemented auto-calculation of Total (Quantity × Rate).  
   - On save: mock-post to API → show confirmation → navigate back to listing page.  

3. **AI Reminder / High-Value Order Alert**  
   - Triggered real-time alert if any order total > ₹10,000 and display on dashboard.  
   - Implemented using custom alert pop-up.  
   - Persisted alerts with `SharedPreferences` to display only if last order amount crossed ₹10,000 only once, on app restart.  

4. **Daily Sales Summary Notification**  
   - Displayed a summary pop-up on app launch: *"In the last 10 orders, X are pending worth ₹Y.",*.  
   - Calculated dynamically from local/mock database.

## ❓ Ques: What I used?

**Ans:**

1. Implemented **BLoC state management** to separate UI from business logic, enabling predictable state handling, scalability, and a clean architecture for long-term maintainability.  
2. Integrated a **Mock API** for simulating backend communication and **SharedPreferences** to persist dark mode preferences, while improving the user experience with daily sales summaries and alerts for high-value orders.
