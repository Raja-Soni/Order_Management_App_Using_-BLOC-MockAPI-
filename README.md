Order Management Application

An Android application built with Flutter for managing orders efficiently. It supports order listing, creation, deletion, and advanced filtering (All, Todayâ€™s, Pending, Delivered, Cancelled) with real-time status updates. Features include detailed order views, a dynamic New Order page with itemized lists and auto-calculated totals, daily sales summaries, one-time high-value order alerts, dark mode persistence, and clean architecture using BLoC with Mock API integration.
