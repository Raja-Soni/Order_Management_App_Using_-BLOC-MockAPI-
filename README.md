* Built a Sales Order Management App in Flutter with order listing, creation, and filtering (All, Todayâ€™s, Pending, Delivered), along with a form-based New Order page featuring auto-calculated totals and validation.

* Implemented BLoC state management to separate UI from business logic, enabling predictable state handling, scalability, and a clean architecture for long-term maintainability.

* Integrated a Mock API for simulating backend communication and SharedPreferences to persist dark mode preferences, while improving the user experience with daily sales summaries and alerts for high-value orders.
